### Chapter 5: Performing a Conditional Search Slides 23-32


#### **The Null Value**
The SQL NULL is the term used to represent a missing value. A NULL value in a table is a value in a field that appears to be blank. A field with a NULL value is a field with no value. It is very important to understand that a NULL value is different than a zero value or a field that contains spaces.


#### **The IS Null Clause**
The IS NULL condition is used in SQL to test for a NULL value. It returns TRUE if a NULL value is found, otherwise it returns FALSE. It can be used in a SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement.


###### Syntax:
The syntax for the IS NULL condition in SQL is:
expression IS NULL


#### **The IS NOT Null Value**
By default, a column can hold NULL values. The NOT NULL constraint enforces a column to NOT accept NULL values. This enforces a field to always contain a value, which means that you cannot insert a new record, or update a record without adding a value to this field.
#### **Wildcards**
A wildcard character is used to substitute one or more characters in a string. 
Wildcard Characters in MS Access:
```
Symbol                               Description                             Example
*                   Represents zero or more characters     bl* finds bl, black, blue, and blob
?                   Represents a single character           h?t finds hot, hat, and hit
_                   Represents any single character  h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit
                     within the brackets
!          Represents any character not in the brackets  h[!oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-               Represents a range of characters               c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
#         Represents any single numeric character         2#5 finds 205, 215, 225, and 230

Wildcard Characters in SQL Server
Symbol      Description                           Example
%       Represents zero or more characters    bl% finds bl, black, blue, and blob
_       Represents a single character         h_t finds hot, hat, and hit
[]      Represents any single character within 
        the brackets                          h[oa]t finds hot and hat, but not hit

^     Represents any character not in the brackets h[^oa]t finds hit, but not hot and hat
-      Represents a range of characters        c[a-b]t finds cat and cbt
All the wildcards can also be used in combinations!
```
Here are some examples showing different LIKE operators with '%' and '_' wildcards:
LIKE Operator
  Description
1. **WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a%':** Finds any values that starts with "a"
2.	**WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%a':** Finds any values that ends with "a"
3. **WHERE CustomerName LIKE '%or%':** Finds any values that have "or" in any position
4. **WHERE CustomerName LIKE '_r%':** Finds any values that have "r" in the second position
5. **WHERE CustomerName LIKE 'a_%_%':** Finds any values that starts with "a" and are at least 3 characters in length
6. **WHERE ContactName LIKE 'a%o':** Finds any values that starts with "a" and ends with "o"


#### **Upperof/Lowerof**


The UPPER() function converts a string to upper-case.


Syntax:
UPPER(text)


The LOWER() function converts a string to lower-case.


Syntax:
LOWER(text)


#### **Pattern Matching**


SQL pattern matching allows you to search for patterns in data if you don't know the exact word or phrase you are seeking. This kind of SQL query uses wildcard characters to match a pattern, rather than specifying it exactly. For example, you can use the wildcard "C%" to match any string beginning with a capital C.


##### **Regular Expression**


Regex, or Regular Expressions, is a sequence of characters, used to search and locate specific sequences of characters that match a pattern.


There are two types:

**Basic Regular Expression (BRE)**

**Extended Regular Expression (ERE)**


The **Basic Regular Expressions** or BRE flavor standardizes a flavor similar to the one used by the traditional UNIX grep command. This is pretty much the oldest regular expression flavor still in use today. One thing that sets this flavor apart is that most metacharacters require a backslash to give the metacharacter its flavor. Most other flavors, including POSIX ERE, use a backslash to suppress the meaning of metacharacters. Using a backslash to escape a character that is never a metacharacter is an error.


The **Extended Regular Expressions** or ERE flavor standardizes a flavor similar to the one used by the UNIX egrep command. “Extended” is relative to the original UNIX grep, which only had bracket expressions, dot, caret, dollar and star. An ERE supports these just like a BRE. Most modern regex flavors are extensions of the ERE flavor. By today’s standard, the POSIX ERE flavor is rather bare bones. The POSIX standard was defined in 1986, and regular expressions have come a long way since then.
